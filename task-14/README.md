Bandit was quite hard. It was easy at the start, and because it got harder only gradually, I was able to complete it. I learnt a lot of commands, which was all new to me. I also understood that the field of cyber security is huge, and there's more to it than just "hacking" stuff. Every level needed some problem solving skills, which made it a bit frustating at times, but satisfying as well.
