This task was very interesting. At first, when I tried to start with making the site, I had no clue where to start and how to progress. It was probably because I did not properly learn to actually make things like buttons, position images etc. So I had stopped halfway while doing it. But when I got back to it after reading through the resource materials about html and css, it became much clearer. Worked my way through making buttons, attaching links to Imagine Dragons' social media links, and the weird looking play button which isn't actually a button :p. I did struggle to position the play button to the far left of the translucent bar, but somehow got it right from trial and error process. Also as I was spending too much time on this, I couldn't make the shop look exactly how it's supposed to look, but I hope that's good enough :").
