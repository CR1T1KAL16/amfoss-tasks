I had never thought I'd make pokedex using python, really. And it was easier that I thought it would be, probably because we already had the main window and the search window done for us. It wasn't hard to learn the code and make another window for "capture" and "inventory", although I found some trouble changing the size of the image, the window and stuff like that. I made it a bit different though, I made a new window for literally everything; that made it easier for me.
I do have a problem in my code.. After capturing a pokemon, since the pokemon inventory doesn't refresh instantly, you have to close the program and run the program again to see the updated inventory. I tried fixing this but I realised i was spending too much time on this task..
