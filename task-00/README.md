To be honest, this was one of the hardest tasks I've done. I had everything go smoothly till the rebooting part. After restarting, when I had chose "Try or Install Ubuntu", it showed me that I needed to disable bitlocker in Windows, so I did exactly that. But the same thing happened after that. So I chose the option under it, "Install Ubuntu (safe graphics)", which evidently worked perfectly fine. I find Ubuntu to be very much faster than Windows, which is really cool. It is also the reason why I did all the tasks in Ubuntu, main reason being the threats made by my mentors xD.
