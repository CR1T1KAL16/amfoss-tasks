Hello world is a task where it makes you look very very small in knowledge, compared to how much there is to learn in computer languages. All the languages, however, were not that different from each other, but since I had only learnt a few languages' basics, the other languages' syntax were difficult to learn. I often got confused with syntax of different languages and have made a lot of mess, cleared that all up though.
