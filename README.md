## SELF INTRO
Hello!<br>
I'm Mukund Menon, currently in my first semester pursuing Computer Science Engineering. The way we can bring our ideas and creativity to life on the digital canvas with just a few lines of code is what interests me, and the ever-evolving nature of this field is what's keeping me intrigued. I'm also thrilled to explore the other "twigs" in this branch of CSE, and find a place where I belong.

## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
Computer was my favourite subject in school. It was the only subject where i felt bad if i missed a class, because this is the only class where you actually need problem solving skills unlike other subjects where you just omit the things you've byhearted. I'm excited to learn from fellow members, share ideas and thoughts, and collectively get better at coding, if I join AmFoss.
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Becoming better at coding in general. I realized I was still lacking while doing the hackerrank task and wish to learn how to solve problems more and improve myself. Also, tasks like
building my telegram bot and web scrapping made me realize how vast computer science is and how it touches every area of life today. I want to explore all of those facets and I want to learn 
about them.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything. Even if it is just helping with some event or doing a project, I am ready to give my blood and sweat.
### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
The tasks were harder than i expected it to be, which was already in the higher standards. But I understand, this is the only way to choose from all the other students who are really really smart!! The tasks were constructed incredibly and that was very impressive. (Which was to be expected from AmFoss :p)
