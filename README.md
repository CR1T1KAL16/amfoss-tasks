## SELF INTRO
Hello!<br>
I'm Mukund Menon, currently in my first semester pursuing Computer Science Engineering. The way we can bring our ideas and creativity to life on the digital canvas with just a few lines of code is what interests me, and the ever-evolving nature of this field is what's keeping me intrigued. I'm also thrilled to explore the other "twigs" in this branch of CSE, and find a place where I belong.

## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
Computer was my favourite subject in school. It was the only subject where i felt bad if i missed a class, because this is the only class where you actually need problem solving skills unlike other subjects where you just omit the things you've byhearted. I'm excited to learn from fellow members, share ideas and thoughts, and collectively get better at coding, if I join AmFoss.
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Becoming better at coding in general. I realized I was still lacking efficiency while doing the competitive programming problems, and took a lot of time solving it, which is not how it's supposed to be done. I wish to learn how to solve problems more and improve myself. More importantly, I want to explore in more depth of the tasks I've done; Time was a constraint which also did not allow me to dig deeper.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my my best to aid and help the club and its members with anything. I'll be going all in, and will be trying my hardest to do the project/task. Even if I'm unable to complete it (hopefully that day wouldn't come), I will make sure I learn how to complete it, and progress further.
### DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
The tasks were harder than i expected it to be, which was already in the higher standards. But I understand, this is the only way to choose from all the other students who are really really smart!! The tasks were constructed incredibly and that was very impressive. (Which was to be expected from AmFoss :p)
