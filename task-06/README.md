The toughest task I've done so far. Had me spend weeks on it. When scraping the data it would work fine for a while, but later on, i noticed the class of the scores and team names change due to their change in font, which in turn, will result in NoneType errors. Worked on it for a few days, scraped data, installed modules in virtual environment, make the bot open the csv file, and finally completed the bot. It felt really great.
